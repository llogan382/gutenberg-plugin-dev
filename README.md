# gutenberg-plugin-dev
A repo to practice Gutenberg functionality for blocks.

The goal is to develop a sound understanding of the basics- how to create blocks, customize them, add content and custom fields, and pull data from the WordPress API for things like post taxonomies, etc.



With a setup in place, the standard workflow is:

    Install dependencies: npm install
    Start development builds: npm start
    Develop. Test. Repeat.
    Create production build: npm run build
